\section{Problem definition}
\par We are interested in a solution of a partial differential equations of the type 
$$\mathcal{L}\mathbf{u(x)} = \mathbf{f(x)},~\forall \mathbf{x}\in\Omega$$
on a given domain $\Omega$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is a linear differential operator, 
${\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=:\mathbf{u(x)},}$ 
where 
${\mathbf{u}:[0,T]\times\Omega\mapsto\Omega}$ 
is some vector-valued function and 
${\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{f}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=:\mathbf{f(x)}},$
$ {\mathbf{f}\colon [0,T] \times \Omega \mapsto \Omega}$ 
vector-valued right hand side.
\par It is necessary to impose boundary conditions on the boundary $\partial\Omega$ of the domain. These conditions are usually of type \textit{Dirichlet}, so that
$$ \mathbf{u(x)} = \mathbf{b_D(x)},~\forall \mathbf{x} \in \partial\Omega $$
where $\mathbf{b_D(x)}$ is some prescribed function. Another type of the boundary condition is so called \textit{Neumann}, where
$$ \nabla \mathbf{u(x)}\cdot\mathbf{n(x)} = \mathbf{b_N(x)},~\forall \mathbf{x}\in\partial\Omega $$
where $\mathbf{n(x)}$ is unit normal to the boundary.
\par We define the inner product of two functions well defined on $\Omega$ 
$$ \langle f,g \rangle := \int_\Omega fg ~\mathrm{d\mathbf{x}} $$
and norm induced by the inner product
$$||f|| := \sqrt{\langle f,f \rangle}$$
