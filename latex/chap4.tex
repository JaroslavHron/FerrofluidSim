\chapter{The Navier-Stokes equations}

\par The goal of this chapter is the formulation of the equations governing physical problems we are interested in.
In the beginning we introduce the postulates and simplifications. With the help of these we derive the dimensionless form of the Navier-Stokes equations
and add forces present in a magnetic field.
\par At the end we formulate the equations in terms of the finite element method, i.e. a weak formulation of our problem is proposed.
