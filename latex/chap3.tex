\chapter{The Level-Set method}

\par Our main goal is the simulation of two-phase flow. It is therefore evident, that some method for interface tracking must be implemented.
The level-set method (LSM) is simple and straightforward mathematical construction that represents the surface. Recent studies [LSM]
improved the level-set method and reduced several drawbacks of original formulation by []. The level-set method presented in our work
conserves volume of fluid. This improvement is important if we would like to analyse the volume of droplets, jets, etc.

\section{Mathematical formulation}

\par Let say, $\Omega \subset \mbb R^n$. We choose a domain $\Omega_1 \subset \Omega$ that represents one fluid phase. Let then $\Omega_2 = \Omega - \Omega_1$.
Let $\Omega_1$
