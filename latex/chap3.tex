\chapter{The Level-Set method}

\par Our main goal is the simulation of two-phase flow. It is therefore evident, that some method for interface tracking must be implemented.
The level-set method (LSM) is simple and straightforward mathematical construction that represents the surface. Recent studies [LSM]
improved the level-set method and reduced several drawbacks of original formulation by []. The level-set method presented in our work
conserves volume of fluid. This improvement is important if we would like to analyse the volume of droplets, jets, etc.

\section{Mathematical formulation}

\par Let say, $\Omega \subset \mbb R^n$. We choose a domain $\Omega_1 \subset \Omega$ that represents one fluid phase. Let then $\Omega_2 = \Omega - \Omega_1$.
We define the interface between two phases as
$$ \Gamma = {\mb x ::~ \mb x \in \partial \Omega}. $$

\par General idea of LSM is to introduce function $\phi:~\Omega \mapsto \mbb R $ so that the interface is being the implicit hypersurface
$$ \Gamma = {\mb x ::~ \phi(\mb x) = 0}. $$
The name level-set is derived from the fact, that surface is represented with the zero-level plane cross section of some hypersurface.

\par Standart level-set function, often refered as \textit{distance level-set} function is defined such that
$$ \phi(\mb x) = \mathrm{Ind}(\mb x) \min () $$
